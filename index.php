            <h2>Welcome to Swasth Bosco</h2>
            <p>In the race to become successful and achieve our goals we have started to ignore the most integral part of our life, our health. If we are healthy it would ultimately become the biggest
                 asset in our life. To make the students aware of the need of a healthy life, Don Bosco School presents <b>SWASTH BOSCO MISSION</b>. This initiative aims at guiding children towards a healthy life. Leading a healthy lifestyle results in a healthy and positive mindset. It is very important for the children of today as they are being suppressed by immense stress and competition. SWASTH BOSCO understands this and takes steps to make this vision possible. </p>
